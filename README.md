## Description

Computer networks are a major technology underpinning current computer systems.
Most of the systems around us are made up of multiple computers communicating and working together.
The process for communication is carried out by the operating system, but the network stacks of today's operating systems are huge programs and very difficult to understand.
Therefore, we learn by creating our own TCP/IP protocol stacks.

Inspired by [KLab Expert Camp](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k2vymbC3vUk5CTJbay4LLEdZ9HemIpZe) and [golangで作るTCPIPプロトコル](https://zenn.dev/satoken/articles/golang-tcpip#%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AF-%2B-%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AChttp%E3%80%81%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE%E7%B5%90%E6%9C%AB%E3%81%AF%E3%81%84%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AB), we implement it in the Go lang.
